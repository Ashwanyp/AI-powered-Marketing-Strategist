*16 years building marketing engines that actually drive revenue growth*

## The Reality Check

I've been in B2B marketing since 2008, back when "growth hacking" wasn't even a term and marketing automation meant setting up basic email sequences. Today, I run global marketing for cybersecurity and SaaS companies, but I still spend time in spreadsheets analyzing conversion funnels.

What sets me apart isn't the buzzwords—it's the track record. I've generated over $2.8M in qualified pipeline across three companies in the last two years. More importantly, I've built teams that consistently hit their numbers quarter after quarter.

**Currently:** Head of Marketing at Network Intelligence, where we're proving that cybersecurity marketing doesn't have to be boring or ineffective.

## What I've Actually Accomplished

**Consistent pipeline growth** across three companies in cybersecurity, supply chain, and AI analytics

**Significant MQL improvements** through marketing automation and lead scoring optimization

**Double-digit conversion rate improvements** by rebuilding nurture workflows and sales handoff processes

**Substantial cost savings** through AI implementation and workflow automation

**Built marketing engines that scale** - systems that grow with the business from startup to enterprise

**Measurable thought leadership growth** with authentic LinkedIn community building

## What I Actually Do Day-to-Day

I run marketing like a revenue operation. That means every campaign gets measured against pipeline contribution, every piece of content gets A/B tested, and every team member understands how their work connects to closed deals.

My specialty is taking marketing from "we think this works" to "we know exactly what drives results." I've done this across cybersecurity (Network Intelligence), supply chain SaaS (LogiNext), AI platforms (Course5), and enterprise services (WNS Global).

The common thread? I build systems that scale. When a company grows from $5M to $50M ARR, the marketing engine I've built grows with it.

## The Technology I Work With

**Marketing Platforms I've Mastered:**
HubSpot, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Marketo, 6sense, ZoomInfo, Salesloft

**AI Tools I Actually Use:**
Jasper AI, ContentShake AI, Albert.ai, plus custom automation workflows built with n8n and Zapier

**Analytics That Matter:**
Google Analytics 4, SEMrush, Ahrefs, FullStory, plus custom attribution modeling that connects marketing spend to revenue

**The Reality:** Tools don't make great marketers. Understanding customer psychology and building repeatable processes does. I happen to be good with both.

## The Industries I Know

**Deep Experience:**
Cybersecurity SaaS, AI/Analytics Platforms, Supply Chain Technology, Enterprise IT Services, Real Estate Technology

**Why This Matters:** I don't just know marketing tactics. I understand how buying decisions get made in these industries, what keeps executives up at night, and how to position complex technology solutions in language that buyers actually understand.

## How I Actually Build Marketing Teams

Most marketing leaders talk about "building high-performance teams" but never explain what that actually means. Here's my approach:

**The Foundation:** I hire for analytical thinking first, marketing skills second. My best team members have been engineers who learned marketing, not marketers who learned to read spreadsheets.

**The Process:** Every new hire gets 30 days to understand our customer journey, attribution model, and revenue impact. No exceptions. If you can't connect your daily work to pipeline numbers, you won't succeed on my teams.

**The Culture:** We operate like a revenue team that happens to do marketing. Weekly pipeline reviews, monthly attribution deep-dives, quarterly strategy sessions where everyone presents data, not opinions.

**The Results:** Teams that consistently hit their numbers because they understand exactly how their work drives results. Low turnover because people grow fast when they understand the business impact of their role.

## The Marketing Operations I Actually Built

**For Network Intelligence (Cybersecurity):**
Rebuilt their entire lead scoring model using behavioral data and intent signals. Implemented agentic AI systems that automatically generate personalized outreach emails based on prospect behavior and company intelligence - directly contributing to our MQL-to-SQL conversion improvements. Also deployed agentic AI for automated backlink generation, systematically building domain authority through relevant cybersecurity publications and industry forums. Created nurture sequences that actually work for security buyers who take 6-9 months to make decisions.

**For LogiNext (Supply Chain SaaS):**
Designed an ABM program for enterprise logistics buyers - people who evaluate software differently than typical SaaS buyers. Created content that speaks to operational challenges, not just business benefits. Built handoff processes between marketing and sales that eliminated lead leakage.

**For Course5 (AI/Analytics):**
Developed go-to-market frameworks for selling complex AI solutions to non-technical buyers. Created marketing operations that scaled with 100%+ year-over-year growth without adding headcount proportionally.

**The Common Thread:** I don't just run campaigns. I build the infrastructure that makes great marketing possible at scale.

## My Marketing Philosophy

The best marketing feels like helpful guidance, not selling. After 16 years, I've learned that every data point represents a human making a decision. My job is building systems that serve both the metrics and the people behind them.

Marketing isn't about creative campaigns or viral content. It's about understanding your customer better than they understand themselves, then building repeatable processes that turn that understanding into revenue.
