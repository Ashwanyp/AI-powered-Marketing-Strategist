## üöÄ The Real Deal

I don't just "do" marketing‚ÄîI engineer revenue growth. **16 years** of turning marketing spend into measurable pipeline, building teams that consistently hit their numbers, and proving that B2B SaaS marketing is equal parts art and science.

**Currently engineering growth at Network Intelligence** (cybersecurity SaaS), where boring security products become compelling business solutions.

</div>

**The Core Principles:**
- üß† **Psychology First:** Understanding buyer behavior before building campaigns
- üìä **Data-Driven:** Every decision backed by measurable outcomes
- üîÑ **Systems Thinking:** Building processes that scale with business growth
- ü§ù **Human-Centered:** Technology serves people, not the other way around
